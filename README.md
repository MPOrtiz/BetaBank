# BetaBank

Project Description:
Beta Bank has observed a gradual but consistent decline in its customer base, with clients leaving the institution month after month. After an internal analysis, the bank's leadership concluded that retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. As a result, the organization has decided to shift its strategic focus toward proactive customer retention.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the bank in the near future. By anticipating churn, Beta Bank aims to implement timely and targeted interventions to improve customer satisfaction, increase loyalty, and reduce overall attrition rates.

Business Impact:
A successful implementation of this model will enable Beta Bank to allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize high-risk clients for retention campaigns, and ultimately protect its revenue streams by reducing customer churn. This data-driven approach to customer relationship management aligns with the bank’s broader commitment to digital transformation and personalized service.
