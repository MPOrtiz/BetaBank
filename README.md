## Beta Bank

📊 Project Description:
Beta Bank has observed a gradual but consistent decline in its customer base, with clients leaving the institution month after month. 📉 After an internal analysis, the bank’s leadership concluded that retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. As a result, the organization has decided to shift its strategic focus toward proactive customer retention. 🔁💼

🎯 Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the bank in the near future. 🧠 By anticipating churn, Beta Bank aims to implement timely and targeted interventions to improve satisfaction, increase loyalty, and reduce attrition rates. 

💡 Business Impact:
A successful implementation of this model will enable Beta Bank to allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize high-risk customers for retention campaigns, and ultimately protect its revenue streams by reducing churn. This data-driven approach aligns with the bank’s commitment to digital transformation and personalized service. 📱📈💬
